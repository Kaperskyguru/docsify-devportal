## Fintr

> A magical financial app for documetation engineers.

## What it is

Fintr generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as a website. To start using it, all you need to do is create an `index.html` and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md).
